# Assignment 2: Machine learning
Predicting passenger data using machine learning for the course DAVE3625.

## Research of algorithms
**Classification:**\
This type of machine learning algorithm seems to favour binary data such as yes/no situations, or 1/0 in values, in other words, a dicrete value or data. Just as it name predicts - it divides data into  classes or categories.

**Regression:**
Regression models are commonly used to predict a continuas value,time series modeling, and determining the causal effect between variables. This type of algorithm ustilises variables of continious nature or real value.

### The prefered algorithm
Since our assignment is to  predict the number of passangers on a spesific date for a spesific bus route, therefore is regression the most suitable for our machine learning algorithm as it gives us a predicted output that best correlates to the given input/data.
